# Event Handling Lab: Verzuz Battle Week 21, Day 2

I chose to go with a Verzuz battle theme, featuring my two favourite rappers - Cam'ron and Nas.

I added a track list array for each character's component, so that the status message will update with the track corresponding with their move.

This isn't really working as a functioning game, but I would like to come back and make the following updates after final project:

- have the game end when a character reaches 0 HP and the ability to push a button to restart the game
- add a random method to the attack function, so that all attacks aren't equal to -10 HP
- add some logic to prevent the same tracks from being used in the same game, i.e a turn-based game with 20 turns each or first to reach 0 HP

Nas vs. Cam'ron (2002-2014)

What's the Beef?: Call it collateral damage. When New York radio station Hot 97 stopped Nas from performing a simulated lynching of Jay Z at their annual Summer Jam concert, Nas went on a rant against the station and its perceived allies, including Killa Cam, who responded by threatening to "R. Kelly" Nas' young daughter.

Where's the Beef Now?: Cam posted a photo with Nas on his Instagram after running into him at an airport, effectively declaring the beef over.

Who Won?: Nas mostly let his minions in the Bravehearts crew handle this one, then stepped in and deaded things with a single verse on 2003's God's Son. But Cam still has the best merch game in the business. Nothing can take that away from him.
