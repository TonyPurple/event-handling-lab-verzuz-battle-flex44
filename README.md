# Event Handling Lab: Verzuz Battle Week 21, Day 2

I chose to go with a Verzuz battle theme, featuring my two favourite rappers - Cam'ron and Nas.

I added a track list array for each character's component, so that the status message will update with the track corresponding with their move.

This isn't really working as a functioning game, but I would like to come back and make the following updates after final project:

- have the game end when a character reaches 0 HP and the ability to push a button to restart the game
- add a random method to the attack function, so that all attacks aren't equal to -10 HP
- add some logic to prevent the same tracks from being used in the same game, i.e a turn-based game with 20 turns each or first to reach 0 HP

Nas vs. Cam'ron (2002-2014)

Unlike the infamous Nas vs. Jay Z beef and even the Cam’ron vs. Jay drama, which still lingers on today, most forgot that Nas and Cam’ron had problems.

But they did. And like most rap beefs, it had its great moments and it had its ugly ones. So for those with a foggy memory, we thought we’d look back at the Nas vs. Cam’ron beef, which would go on to turn into a whole Bravehearts vs. Dipset beef.

What's the Beef?: Call it collateral damage. When New York radio station Hot 97 stopped Nas from performing a simulated lynching of Jay Z at their annual Summer Jam concert, Nas went on a rant against the station and its perceived allies, including Killa Cam, who responded by threatening to "R. Kelly" Nas' young daughter.

It’s actually a pretty classic diss. The freestyle gave birth to the infamous “I’ll smack the kufi off your head” line that Jim Jones started. Nas didn’t respond himself. Instead, he sent one of the younger members of his Bravehearts crew, Nashawn — who also went by one of the worst rap names ever, Millennium Thug — to respond. In his diss, Nashawn claimed that Cam’ron has AIDs, and he also blasted Cam’s second in command, Jim Jones.

After Nashawn’s record hit the streets, the Diplomats released a mixtape called Diplomats Volume 3. On the tape, Cam starts his shit-talking right away, ranting about Nashawn and other Queensbridge street guys like Little E (who moved packs for Cam, apparently) and the incarcerated Sherm the Worm.

Many Dipset members sent their shots, but Jim Jones was the most invested in the beef, releasing freestyle after freestyle. And there was that iconic rant on “I Really Mean It,” which is a masterpiece. It was officially a crew thing. Dipset was involved and Nas’ crew, Bravehearts, was involved.

In the end of 2003, Nas dropped his God’s Son album, featuring a Bravehearts posse cut called “Zone Out,” where Nas finally sends some shots back at Cam:

“You got a house in Virginia

The only way you sicker than us

Gettin’ bagged with .22’s now you’s a ridiculous f***

No need for the gun play, it’s ok, ’cause you dyin’ anyway”

(“House in Virginia” = HIV. Get it?)

Over the next couple of years there would be tension, but the diss records basically stopped. The two parties still traded barbs, however.

Jim Jones said something slick on “Summer of Miami,” while Nas shot little sly lines on “Streets Disciple” and “Money Over Bullshit.” But for the most part, the beef settled in a space where the two parties just didn’t like each other.

Where's the Beef Now?: Cam posted a photo with Nas on his Instagram after running into him at an airport, effectively declaring the beef over.

Who Won?: Nas mostly let his minions in the Bravehearts crew handle this one, then stepped in and deaded things with a single verse on 2003's God's Son. But Cam still has the best merch game in the business. Nothing can take that away from him.
