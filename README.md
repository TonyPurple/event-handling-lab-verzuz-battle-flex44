# Event Handling Lab: Verzuz Battle Week 21, Day 2

I chose to go with a Verzuz battle theme, featuring my two favourite rappers - Cam'ron and Nas.

I added a track list array for each character's component, so that the status message will update with the track corresponding with their move.

This isn't really working as a functioning game, but I would like to come back and make the following updates after final project:

- have the game end when a character reaches 0 HP and the ability to push a button to restart the game
- add a random method to the attack function, so that all attacks aren't equal to -10 HP
- add some logic to prevent the same tracks from being used in the same game, i.e a turn-based game with 20 turns each or first to reach 0 HP
